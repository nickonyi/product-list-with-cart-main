## Overview

This project is a simple front-end application featuring a product list with a cart system. Users can browse through a list of products, add items to the cart, and view the total cost dynamically. Built as a practice project, it focuses on leveraging core JavaScript and DOM manipulation to create an interactive and functional shopping experience.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add items to the cart and remove them
- Increase/decrease the number of items in the cart
- See an order confirmation modal when they click "Confirm Order"
- Reset their selections when they click "Start New Order"
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

It also helped me gain a deeper understanding of JavaScript's role in building dynamic web applications.
